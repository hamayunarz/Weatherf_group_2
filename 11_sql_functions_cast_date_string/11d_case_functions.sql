/* THE CASE OPERATOR 
 * With the CASE operator we can run a conditional query. Itâ€™s like if/else in other programming languages. 
 */

/* Example: 
 * Using the table 'flights' categorize early and late flights:
--   'early': arr_delay < 0 
--   'slightly late': arr_delay between 0-15
--   'late': arr_delay between 15-60 
--   'very late': arr_delay > 60

-- CASE can be used to bucketize a column...
