- **Intro to SQL** 🧑‍💻: Understanding the basics of SQL and its role in data analysis.
- **Filtering** 🔍: Learn how to filter data using `WHERE` clauses.
- **Aggregations** ➗: Use aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT` to analyze your data.
- **Group By** 👥: Group data based on specified criteria and apply aggregate functions.
- **DDL Functions** ⚙️: Explore Data Definition Language (DDL) functions to define and modify database structures.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys** 🔑: Understand relational database design and how to enforce data integrity.
- **Joining Data** 🔗: Learn how to combine data from multiple tables using various types of `JOIN`.
- **String, Types, Date, and Condition Functions** 🧾: Manipulate and analyze text, numeric, and date data.
- **CTEs and Subqueries** 🧠: Master Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries to simplify complex queries.
