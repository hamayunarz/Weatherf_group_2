## Objectives

- What is a Cloud Service Provider ? 

- What are Cloud Databases ?

- Types of Databases

- Managing and Accessing Relational Databases 

- Database vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake

  


## 1. What is a Cloud and a Cloud Service Provider ?

- In it’s most basic sense **a Cloud** is a computer running 24 hours a day 365 days a year that users can access whenever needed for various tasks

- A **Cloud Service Provider** is a company that has the resources (data centers, wide area network, ...etc.) to offer other companies and clients **IT infrastructure on demand**. Companies and clients can then scale up or down their different services and only pay the cloud service provider for what they actually use 

- Cloud Service Providers such as **Amazon** (Amazon Web Services), **Google** (Google Cloud Platform), **Microsoft** (MS Azure) and many others `offer hundreds of different cloud services` for the smallest to the largest of companies and individual customers/users

## 2. What is a Cloud Database ?

- A Cloud Database is one of the many cloud services that Cloud Service Providers offer

- A cloud database runs on a **cloud computing platform** (i.e. Google Cloud) and access to the database is provided as-a-service
	([more on SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/saas-vs-paas-vs-iaas-whats-the-difference-and-how-to-choose/), 
	[also here](https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas-paas-saas))

- Storing data in a cloud database enables authenticated users to access data remotely, from anywhere in the world, via a working internet connection

- A much cheaper and faster option than managing a database on own server

## 3. Types of Databases

There are different Types of Database structures. We will be focusing on the ***relational databases***. But it is good to know the other database types.

<img src="./images/database_structures.jpeg" alt="database_structures" width="800"/>

**SQL database (relational databases) features:**

> A relational database is **table-oriented** where **every bit of data has a link with every other bit of data**. It has a row-based table structure which connects related data elements. **predefined relationships**

- use `flexible queries` to access data
- use queries that span `mutliple tables`
- enforce certain `constraints on your data`
- `well documented` access language (SQL is ISO standardized)
- **examples:** PostgreSQL, Mysql, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle...

**NoSQL database features:**

> *A NoSQL database uses a variety of formats, such as documents, graphs, wide columns, etc, which offers great flexibility and scalability to a database design. (NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL)*

- when your access patterns are known beforehand and simple
- when data model fits (facebook connections graph)
- when you need flexible data storage/need to avoid constraints (NoSQL databases are schemaless)
- when you need low latency and easy horizontal scaling (ex: Apple has a 75,000-server NOSQL database!)
- **examples:** Cassandra, MongoDB, HBase, DynamoDB

**Other types of databases:** 

1. **Hierarchical database**: Hierarchical database follows a ranking order or a parent-child relationship to structure data.
2. **Network database**: Network database is similar to the hierarchical database but with some changes. The network database allows the child record to connect with various parent records, therefore, allowing two-directional relationships.
3. **Object-Oriented database**: In an object-oriented database, information is stored in an object-like manner.

## 4. Managing and Accessing Relational Databases 

> explain the elements visually with a Chart like [HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13V-gXIXltuM4sI6ERk8OlHWKO0SHTGBUFGROOsUWUMM/edit#slide=id.g14fe6e8ba1a_0_250) first (can be optimized!) then go over each of the following 

####  Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

- A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to **create, update, and administer a relational database**

- Most relational database management systems **use the SQL language** to access the database and run queries

- Examples of famous RDBMS are **PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite** and **Microsoft SQL Server**

- We will use PostgreSQL since it is very powerful but open-source, i.e. free to use without a license

#### Database Server

- **A database server is a computer which uses a DBMS** that provides database services to other computers, as defined by the **client–server model**

- Users access a database server through a **client** program running on the user's computer

- To access the database server, you need the following:

>1. the database server's host **IP address** (a.k.a DB end-point, this can be the **local host** if the DB is local on our machine)
>2. **User name** 
>3. **Password**
>4. **Port number** (depends on the DBMS)
>5. **Database name** (because there can be multiple databases on the same server)

#### Computer/Server Port

- A port number is a way to identify a specific **application** to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a computer/server

- All network-connected devices come equipped with standardized ports that have an assigned number

- These numbers are reserved for certain protocols and their associated function

- For example some of the most commonly used ports: 
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages, for example, always go to port 80
  - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) messages go to port 443

- For PostgreSQL, port 5432 is the default

#### Database Client

- the database **client** is any software that can be used to **connect** to the database server and **perform operations** on the data stored there (e.g. retrieve a table or parts of a table)

- There are **command line clients**, like **psql**, and **GUI clients**, like **DBeaver** or **pgAdmin**

- all clients need the **5 pieces of information** listed above to connect to any database server

## 5. Database vs Data Warehouse vs Data Lake



### Database

[**Wikipedia:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database) In computing, a database is an **organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically**. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage.

[**Oracle:**](https://www.oracle.com/za/database/what-is-database/) A database is an **organized collection of structured information, or data**, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

### Data Warehouse 

Data Warehouse is used to store **large amount of structured data** coming from multiple sources.  Because of **very well defined structure**, it’s easy to perform reliable analytical requests (**optimized for analysis**). 

`An example` of a Data Warehouse could be a `BI Analytics system` where the data is already preprocessed (e.g. having a table that is grouped by months and products, with calculated metrics) and very easy to query.

### Data Lake

Data Lake is used to **store structured, semi-structured and unstructured data**, which is not necessarily processed (`keeping the data in the raw format`). Such a setup creates a flexible infrastructure which enables more open questions. Only when the data is needed it will be properly transformed.

In real world, you could also find infrastructures that are a hybrid solution between a Data Warehouse and a Data Lake.
