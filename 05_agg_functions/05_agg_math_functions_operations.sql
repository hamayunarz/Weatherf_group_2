/* FUNCTIONS for DATA AGGREGATION - Key Element of Data Analytics
 * 
 * Aggregate functions, such as AVG(), SUM(), and COUNT(), compute a single result from a set of values. 
 * They allow us to condense large and complex sets of values into meaningful summary measures. 
 * The aggregated results provide a general overview that simplifies analysis.
 * 
 * Aggregated data can reveal trends, patterns, and insights that may not be apparent when examining 
 * individual data points.
 * 
 * Some common methods of summarizing are:
		
		- Minimum
		- Maximum
		- Count
		- Distinct Count
		- Mean
		- Sum

/* MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS and OPERATORS - Essential Tools for Data Manipulation
 * 
 * Mathematical functions, such as ROUND(), FLOOR(), and CEILING(), perform various
 * calculations on numerical data. They enable us to transform and manipulate data to derive 
 * meaningful insights and perform precise computations.
 
 * These functions are crucial for refining data, ensuring accuracy, and facilitating complex 
 * mathematical operations. By applying these functions, we can streamline data processing and 
  * enhance the quality of our analyses.

/* ROUND() Function:
	The ROUND() function is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places. 
	It takes two arguments: the numeric value to be rounded and the number of decimal places.
	For example, ROUND(5.7, 0) would yield 6, and ROUND(3.14159, 2) would yield 3.14.

	The FLOOR() function rounds a numeric value down to the nearest integer that is less than or 
	equal to the input value.
	For instance, FLOOR(5.7) results in 5, and FLOOR(-42.8) yields -43.

/* Let’s explore DIVISION OPERATIONS in PostgreSQL

You’ll notice that division with only integers and division with decimal numbers yield different 
results. And what is result of the Modulo?
*/

/* Floor Division (Integer Division):
	When dividing two integers (e.g., 5 / 2), PostgreSQL truncates the result towards zero, 
	resulting in an integer quotient. Floor Division ensures that the result is always an integer, 
	discarding any fractional part. 
	In this case, 5 / 2 yields 2, and (-5) / 2 yields -2.
