# What are CTEs` ?

Common Table Expression, or CTE, is a powerful SQL concept / technique / construct that helps to keep complex queries understandable and more versatile. It first appeared in the SQL standard in **1999**, and the first implementations began appearing in **2005**.

#  1. Definition and Types
Common Table Expressions allow you to create **temporary *named* result sets** from a simple query. You can then use these result sets in subsequent statements of the query. CTEs act as virtual tables, created during the execution of a query, used by the query, and eliminated after query execution.
> **Flashback:** every SQL query returns a result set - a table with records and columns.


### There are two types of CTEs:

**Non-Recursive** CTEs are mainly used for filtering and transforming data, joining tables, also for performing calculations without the need for complex subqueries.

**Recursive** CTEs are helpful when you have to work with hierarchical data, compute recursive aggregates, implement graph algorithms, do recursive calculations like factorials or the Fibonacci series, or generate a sequence of numbers or dates.

# 2. Non-Recursive CTEs

In this lecture we are going to focus on the none-recursive type of Common Table Expressions.

## Syntax
Common Table Expressions start with the **WITH** statement, followed by the **Expression Name**, the name for a **SELECT Statement** inside parantesis, which is the content of a single CTE. You can define one or more common table expression in this fashion. The CTEs construct ends with a **final query** that will give us our result output.
```sql
WITH my_cte AS (
                SELECT column1,
                       column2,
                       column3,
                FROM table_name
               )
               
SELECT * FROM my_cte;
```
# 4. Example
**Cities with the max number of airports**
```sql
WITH airports_count_cities AS (
    SELECT city, 
    	   COUNT(*) AS airport_count
    FROM airports 
    WHERE city IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY (city)
),
max_count_cities AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM airports_count_cities                 
    WHERE airport_count = (SELECT MAX(airport_count) FROM airports_count_cities)
)
SELECT * 
FROM max_count_city;
```

# 5. In a Nutshell

As you can see with CTEs we can perform Multistage Data Transformation in a linear step-by-step way.

### Benefits of CTEs

- **Readability:** the query logic is easier to follow and to understand
- **Resusage of intermediate results:** a CTE can be referenced multiple times in a query
- **Maintanance:** single steps can be easily tested, which helps a lot when debugging or optimising a query
- **Substitute for a VIEW:** often DB permissions do not allow saving VIEWs, also usage of VIEWs can be significantly more expensive
- **Recursive ability:** Self-referencing queries (see below)

### Limitations of CTEs

- **Duration and scope:** CTEs results are used only within a query and are not stored in the database
- **Indexing**: Because CTEs are not stored in a database as just temporary result sets they can't be indexed
- **Conditions:** CTE's can't be used in the WHERE clause
- **Nesting:** Depending the meaning of Nesting. For once it is not possible to start another CTE chain within a CTE. If you mean by "nested CTEs" multiple CTEs keep in mind that some databases limit the number of CTEs used in a query.
- **Compatibility:** Even though CTEs are quite popular, some database management systems do not support them, or have limited support.

## Excurse: CTE vs Subquery

|CTE|Subquery|
|:---|:---|
|Typically more readable since CTEs can be used to give structure to your query	|Typically less readable, especially if there are many nested queries|
|Allows for recursiveness |Does not allow for recursiveness|
|CTEs must have unique CTE_EXPRESSION_NAMES when used in a query |Subqueries don’t always have to be explicitly named|
|CTEs cannot be used in a WHERE clause	|Subqueries can be used in a WHERE clause|


># 6. What about Recursive CTEs?
>
>Recursive CTEs are used in management of hierarchical or graph-based data structures, or for generating sequences of numbers or dates, calculating the Fibonacci sequence or factorials, etc.
>
>It is used to solve problems requiring repeated processing (kind of loops) of the same data aka recursion. The recursive query references itself until a condition met. This condition has to be specified in a WHERE clause to stop the recursion.
>
>**Example:** Generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 50.  
NOTE: This is a Microsoft SQL Server dialect example. PostgreSQL recursive CTE statement starts like this: `WITH RECURSIVE...`
