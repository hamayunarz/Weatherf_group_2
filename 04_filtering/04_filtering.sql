-- SQL - Filtering data with the WHERE clause

/* The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter rows returned by a SELECT statement. 
 * It allows you to specify conditions that determine which rows are included in the result set. 
 * By applying conditions, you can retrieve specific data based on your criteria.
 *  
 * Syntax:
		SELECT select_list
		FROM table_name
		WHERE condition
		ORDER BY sort_expression;
 *
 * Operators in the WHERE clause:
		=: Equal
		>: Greater than
		<: Less than
		>=: Greater than or equal
		<=: Less than or equal
		<> or !=: Not equal
		LIKE / ILIKE: Returns true if a value matches a pattern
		IN: Returns true if a value matches any value in a list
		BETWEEN: Returns true if a value is between a range of values
		AND: Logical operator (both conditions must be true)
		OR: Logical operator (at least one condition must be true)
		NOT: Negates the result of other operators
		IS NULL: Returns true if a value is NULL

-- 2: Operators: >= and <=

/* The >= operator checks whether a value is greater than or equal to a specified value.
 * Similarly, the <= operator checks whether a value is less than or equal to a specified value.

-- 3. Pattern matching operators: LIKE and ILIKE
/* The LIKE operator checks whether a text matches a specified pattern.
 * The ILIKE operator is a case-insensitive variant of LIKE.
 * The pattern can be written with wildcard operators: '%abc%', '%abc', 'abc%', 'a_c', '_bc' etc  
 * The % wildcard operator which represents any sequence of characters at this position.
 * The _ wildcard operator represents exactly one character.

-- 7: Negation logical operator: NOT
/* The NOT operator negates a boolean expression. It inverts a condition.
 * For example, if you have a condition like NOT (age > 18), it checks whether the age is not greater than 18.

-- 8:
/* WHERE with NULL values
  
 * A NULL value represents the absence of data. It’s not a specific value like a number or string; 
 * rather, it indicates that no valid data exists for a particular field.
  
 * As NULL is not a value itself, it isn’t directly comparable to other values using standard operators.
 
 * The special clause IS NULL or IS NOT NULL is needed to check NULL value exists or not in a table.
